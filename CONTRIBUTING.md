First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Prepare a pull request

1. Fork the project to your GitHub account using fork button in right upper
corner of GitHub UI.
1. Make sure the project compiles and tests pass.
1. Create a new git branch with brief and meaningful name that describes the changes
you want to make.
1. Check if your changes are covered by unit tests, add new unit tests if necessary.
1. When finished, again make sure the project compiles with your changes and tests pass.
1. Create a pull request to the main project using GitHub UI.

Please follow the guideline below for your PRs:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the title to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally in the description
